# Serverless SaaS Starter - Public SPA

This is the single-page app that handles the public portion of your SaaS -
before the user signs in. It contains information that sells the user on
signing up for your service, and handles the login flow.

After login the user will be redirected to the
[application client-side SPA](../app-client/README.md).
