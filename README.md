# Serverless SaaS Starter Kit

Provides a starter kit with the basics of a modern Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
software stack, including:

   * RESTful API - using serverless technology
   * SPAs (Single Page Applications) - for both:
      * the external (pre-login), and
      * internal (business guts) part of your SaaS app
   * Authentication - handled by third parties, currently:
      * Google
      * GitHub
   * Payment processing - subscription-based, handled by Stripe


## Authentication

The starter kit allows a user to sign in to your SaaS application using their
preferred third-party identity provider. It uses Google and GitHub, but you
could add others as needed.

There are no server-side redirects since this kit is built with a design of a
SPA and RESTful API. A good explanation of the flow implemented in this kit can
be found in [Matthew Beale's excellent blog post][madhatted-oauth].


## Payment Processing

Payment processing will be handled via [Stripe].


## Code Organization

The code is organized into a collection of small codebases (some would say
microservices), each with its distinct responsibility:

   * [Public SPA](./public-spa/README.md) - for the pre-login portion of your app
   * [Application SPA](./app-client/README.md) - the logged-in actual business portion of your app
   * [Authentication API](./auth-api/README.md) - a serverless API that handles authentication for your app
   * [Business API](./business-api/README.md) - a serverless API that handles your actual business service
   * [Payments](./payments/README.md) - a serverless API and related services for payment processing


### Serverless Microservices

The serverless microservices are built using [the Serverless framework][SLS] on
top of [AWS] services, including [AWS API Gateway][APIGW].
